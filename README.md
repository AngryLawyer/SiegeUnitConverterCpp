SiegeUnitConverterCpp
=====================

Siege Unit Converter (C++) - a C++ program to convert unit sprites from the computer game Siege to bitmaps, and back again.

I think this was originally written using Visual Studio 2003, and will probably need effort to de-Windows it to make it work today.

Siege Unit Converter is MIT Licensed.
